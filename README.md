This is Python-based implementation of the Automated Queue Management System (AQMS); it faithfully reproduces the functionality of the Java version while leveraging Python’s simplicity and Tkinter’s ease of GUI development.

---Features Implemented in Python Version---

1. Patient registration
2. Automatic token generation
3. Queue calling logic
4. CSV persistence
5. Login authentication
6. Modular OOP structure
7. Desktop GUI (Tkinter)

#UPDATE

-> Had to refactor the project to use the terminal to run and operate the project, through user_input function for data entry and registering.

---Reasoning---

-> This is because the tkinter module was refused to function despite being installed and none of the fixes used including sudo operations could get my GUI up and running.
